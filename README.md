This repository holds all of my personal projects. Currently they're binned into these different categories:

    - [Natural Language Processing (NLP)]()
   
2. [Software Engineering Projects]()

3. Tableau Vizualizations (Coming Soon!)

Each category has their own variety of projects and should be accompanied by some form of documentation. 

## Background

Hi there!

My name is Adam Rauckhorst - thank you for taking a look at my project portfolio! A little bit about me. I did my undergraduate at The University of Texas at Austin where I majored in Economics. My career has taken me from leading large scale SaaS implementations for the big 4 telecom companies to managing a small, remote team revolutionizing (and removing the stress of) how US citizens living abroad stay complient on their taxes. The one constant throughout my career is a love of data and using it to make the best informed business decisions, as well as using it to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical folks.

Now I focus on programming with a special interest in Machine Learning and Data Science, which I've discovered to be my passion!
