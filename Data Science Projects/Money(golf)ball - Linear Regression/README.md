### Money(golf)ball: Predicting PGA Tour Pro Earnings with Linear Regression

## Summary

In this project, I wanted to see if I could predict the earnings of a PGA Tour professional based on his playing stats using Linear Regression. The game of golf is so variable, a game where inches can equate to thousands or even hundreds of thousands of dollars in earnings, so this was an interesting problem to tackle.
My final model had an R-Squared score of 0.71 and a mean absolute error around $600,000.

## Data

Data was scraped from the [PGA Tour website](https://www.pgatour.com/stats.html) using BeautifulSoup.
