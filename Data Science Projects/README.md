# Data Science Projects

## Introduction

Here you'll find my personal Data Science projects, some of which I worked on for the Data Science Bootcamp that I completed called Metis. My projects are primarily in Python, as that is my primary programming language. I try to cater my projects towards my passions and interests, as well as learning new tools and practicing core fundamentals. 

## Projects

[<h3 align = "left">Recommending Channels on Twitch using Collaborative Filtering</h3>](https://github.com/ARauckhorst/Personal_Projects/tree/master/Data%20Science%20Projects/Twitch%20Channel%20Collaborative%20Filtering%20Recommender)

#### Project At A Glance
- Twitch.tv is the most popular live-streaming website. It focuses primarily on content related to videogames.
- Project Goal: Create a collaborative filtering recommender to find high-quality new channels to follow.
- Project Tools: **Python** (libraries: pandas, RankFM, requests, threading), **APIs**.
- Data: All data was collected through the [Twitch public API.](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api)

[<h3 align = "left">Topic Modeling the Tim Ferriss Show</h3>](https://github.com/ARauckhorst/Personal_Projects/tree/master/Data%20Science%20Projects/Topic%20Modeling%20The%20Tim%20Ferriss%20Show)

#### Project At A Glance
- Tim Ferriss is an author and investor who hosts a popular show called *The Tim Ferriss Show*. His guests come from a variety of domains, from artists to CEOs to athletes to philosophers. 
- Project Goal: Apply topic modeling to distill down the main themes of the podcast and create a simple content based recommender to find new episodes for a new listener. 
- Project Tools: **Python** (libraries: numpy, pandas, Scikit-Learn, NLTK, spacy, BeautifulSoup, scipy).
- Data: Transcripts for my text corpus were scraped from [Tim Ferriss's blog.](https://tim.blog/2018/09/20/all-transcripts-from-the-tim-ferriss-show/)

[<h3 align = "left">Money(golf)ball: Predicting PGA Tour Pro Earnings</h3>](https://github.com/ARauckhorst/Personal_Projects/tree/master/Data%20Science%20Projects/Money(golf)ball%20-%20Linear%20Regression)

#### Project At A Glance
- Project Goal: Predict PGA Tour Pro earnings using Linear Regression for a given year using their playing statistics. 
- Project Tools: **Python** (libraries: numpy, pandas, Scikit-Learn, BeautifulSoup).
- Data: Statistics scraped from the [PGA Tour website.](https://www.pgatour.com/stats.html)

[<h3 align = "left">Predicting SBA Loan Default</h3>](https://github.com/ARauckhorst/Personal_Projects/tree/master/Data%20Science%20Projects/Predicting%20SBA%20Loan%20Defaults)

#### Project At A Glance 
- Project Goal: Use classification to predict whether or not a small business loan will default. Models tested included Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost (the ulimate winner). 
- Project Tools: **Python** (libraries: numpy, pandas, Scikit-Learn), **AWS EC2**, **PostgreSQL**.
- Data: Dataset was collected from Kaggle [here.](https://www.kaggle.com/c/loanapprove/data)
